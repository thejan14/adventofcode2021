# Advent of code 2021

Welcome to my advent of code 2021 contribution! The solutions are written in JavaScript using Node.js. When writing the solutions code I primarily aim for readability but try to always keep performance considerations in mind. Happy reading!

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Run the code via 
```
node dayXX/partX.js
```

You can also have a look at my repl at [https://repl.it/@thejan14/adventofcode2021](https://repl.it/@thejan14/adventofcode2021). Use the shell to run the solution of your choice.
